description: my take on connect the dots game

what's been done:
- starry sky background using spritekit
- basic logic for the dot connecting mechanism
- reusable objects for dot object & level


what's needs to be done:
- next button after level is done
- the visual cue for line path direction
- more object path x,y in json
- designated square pan gesture area
(directly related to x,y. now using % to the screen which is not ideal)



*not sure when i'll get back to this, but hopefully i will, in this lifetime
cheers!
